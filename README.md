This repository contains my SQL practice files from class. It covers the fundamental SQL operations including DDL, DML, TCL, constraints, set operators, and filtering queries.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

CREATE â€“ Creating databases, tables, views

ALTER â€“ Modifying existing tables (adding/removing columns)

DROP â€“ Deleting tables or databases

TRUNCATE â€“ Removing all rows from a table

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

INSERT â€“ Adding new rows into a table

UPDATE â€“ Modifying existing rows

DELETE â€“ Deleting rows from a table

SELECT â€“ Retrieving data from one or more tables

3. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

COMMIT â€“ Saving changes permanently

ROLLBACK â€“ Undoing changes

SAVEPOINT â€“ Marking a point in a transaction to rollback to

4. Constraints & Auto Increment

PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY

NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT

AUTO_INCREMENT (for generating sequential IDs automatically)

5. Filtering & Conditions

WHERE clause for row filtering

HAVING clause with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

ORDER BY for sorting results

GROUP BY for grouping records

6. Set Operators

UNION â€“ Combine results of two queries (removes duplicates)

UNION ALL â€“ Combine results including duplicates

Learning Outcomes

By practicing these queries, I have learned:

How to create and manage database structures.

How to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently.

How to use transactions for safe data handling.

How to apply conditions, grouping, and set operations in queries.
INTERSECT â€“ Returns common records (if supported by DBMS)

MINUS / EXCEPT â€“ Returns records from first query not in second (depends on DBMS)
